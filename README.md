# Parent Control

##Responsible entertainment rather than control

A dramatically new approach to parental control beyond its usual facilities lets you understand principles and reasons for using our modes, so you can communicate with your child in respectful and friendly manner. 

The methodical support for parents will help to explain to a child of any age and sex how and why the control works, which risks it is aiming to eliminate and how it facilitates and makes life of a child fuller rather than closes opportunities.

Our application is tended to be a way of effective communication between parents and children and serves to optimal safety and profound monitoring of child’s life and web activities.
